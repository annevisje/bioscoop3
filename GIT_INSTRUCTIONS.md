So you want to make a feature for the cinema?

1. Make a branch from master, named after your feature (e.g: ticket-scanner)
2. Checkout your branch (a.k.a go work on your branch)
3. Make some changes
4. When you're done, commit everything (commit everything inbetween important additions to prevent losing anything)
5. Checkout the test branch
6. Merge your feature into the test branch
7. See if everythings working, if you're comfortable:
8. Checkout the master
9. Merge test branch into master
